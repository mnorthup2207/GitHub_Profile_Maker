- A PDF is then generated with the users name, bio, location, blog, followers, following, stars, and repo amount.
- The user will need to use the package.json to "npm install" all dependencies for this application.

## Intended Use
- This application is created with the project or hiring manager in mind. Instead of simply having users GitHub profile links, the user can have dynamically created content that is clean and deliverable in a PDF form.
